This survey intends to investigate some of themost relevant approaches both in the areas of single-document and multipledocument summarization, giving special emphasis to empirical methods andextractive techniques. Some promising approaches that concentrate on specificdetails of the summarization problem are also discussed. Special attention isdevoted to automatic evaluation of summarization systems, as future researchon summarization is strongly dependent on progress in this area.
